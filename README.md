Implement and demonstrate control of a one-degree-of-freedom “helicopter” system: a motor on a lever arm drives the arm’s angle, and an onboard IMU (accelerometer + gyro) estimates the angle via a complementary filter. A user enters a target angle through serial-interface, and a PID controller drives the arm to the target. Key components: I²C IMU reading, PWM motor drive, angle estimation, PID loop at 1 kHz, and real-time display of angle and control signal.
